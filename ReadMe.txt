AirbnTots is a Chrome extension intended to help travelers with young children find a suitable Airbnb listing in a more efficient manner.
I use sample data from listings in NYC from the Inside Airbnb website: http://insideairbnb.com/.
Using this data, I built a Random Forest model combined with a sentiment analysis algorithm in order to determine which listings are young kid friendly.

The potential user is any Airbnb guest traveling with young children.
The user needs to download my Chrome extension and load it at Chrome://extensions in developer mode.
The user should go to the Airbnb website and enter his/her search.
Then, click on the AirbnTots extension, and the AirbnTots logo will appear under the young kid friendly listings.
