AirbnTots is a Chrome extension intended to help travelers with young children find a suitable Airbnb listing in a more efficient manner.
I use sample data from listings in NYC from the Inside Airbnb website: http://insideairbnb.com/.
Using this data, I built a Random Forest model combined with a sentiment analysis algorithm in order to determine which listings are young kid friendly.

The potential user is any Airbnb guest traveling with young children.

Instructions:
1. Download the Chrome extension and load it at Chrome://extensions (you need to be in developer mode - top right corner of the screen)
2. Go to the Airbnb website and enter your search.
3. Click on the AirbnTots extension, and the AirbnTots logo will appear under the young kid friendly listings.
4. Notice: It is possible to use the extension locally by downloading all the files from the current repository and installing flask (and some python libraries).
