       "'Laurie\\'s home was the perfect place for my nine days in Brooklyn. I was visiting my daughter/husband/and baby who live just a few blocks away. It was nice to come \"home\" to a quiet/comfy room after a long, busy day. It was also wonderful to have breakfast and coffee every morning. Right after I arrived she texted me to find out what I liked for breakfast. Plus, she has a wonderful espresso machine. Laurie was a great host. We only crossed paths a few times, which was fine, but she keeps in touch to make sure your stay is going well. Thank you Laurie!\\r\\n\\r\\nNov./Dec. 2012'"
